# Association of Neighborhood Socioeconomic status and Working Memory Activation
*Prior work has shown that environmental adversity affects cognitive development. However, it is unclear how these challenges impact brain systems, like the executive system, which underlie cognition. The current study examined the association of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) with executive system activation during a working memory task in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort.
